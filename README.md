# Bring-the-Change

## Normal Mode

Write a Register class with a change function that takes an amount of money and returns the number of quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies needed to produce that amount:

r = Register.new r.change 0.99 # => [3, 2, 0, 4]

## Hard Mode

### Option 1 - OO:

* Write a set of tests to verify that your register works (preferably before writing the register) * Initialize the register with a fixed number of each coin. Note as the coins are distributed, and e.g. use 2 nickels when you run out of dimes. What should happen when you can't make change at all? Write specs for it and then implement it.

Option 2 - Enumerable:

Allow for the addition / removal of coins e.g. we phase out the penny but add a 33Â¢ piece.
